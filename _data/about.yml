title: Bioinformatician & Data Scientist
intro: >-
  <b>Hi!</b> I'm a graduate bioinformatician with a passion for unravelling the
  complexities of biological data.  Both my Bachelor's and Master's projects
  have been focused on exploring and analysing next-generation sequencing data,
  which has laid the foundation to my technical abilities and sparked an immense
  interest and curiosity in the field.  I believe in continuous learning and I
  dedicate time daily to further refine my skills and stay updated with the
  latest  tools and technologies.<br> As I seek new opportunities, I am eager to
  bring my expertise to a team that values innovation and development. If
  you're in search of someone dedicated and enthusiastic, I'd love discussing
  how I can be an asset to your company.
